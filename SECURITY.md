# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Head Start project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### 📧 How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

📧 **security@headstart.example.com**

Include the following information:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on complexity

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🔐 Security Measures

### Application Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers implemented
- **HTTPS Only**: All production traffic uses HTTPS
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers configured
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks

### Data Protection

- **No Personal Health Information**: We do not store PHI
- **Local Processing**: Image analysis happens client-side
- **No Data Persistence**: Images are not stored on servers
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in environment variables
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies and base images updated regularly

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side Processing

- **Model Files**: AI models are downloaded to client browsers
- **Image Processing**: Images processed locally in browser
- **No Server Upload**: Images never leave the user's device

### Third-Party Dependencies

- **Regular Audits**: Dependencies audited for vulnerabilities
- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot configured for security updates
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary packages included

## 🔍 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens
- **Input Sanitization**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Secure Defaults**: Use secure configurations by default

### Dependencies

- **Audit New Dependencies**: Check security status before adding
- **Keep Updated**: Regularly update to latest secure versions
- **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary permissions

### Medical Content Security

- **Accuracy Verification**: Ensure medical information is accurate
- **Source Validation**: Verify medical sources are authoritative
- **Disclaimer Inclusion**: Include appropriate medical disclaimers
- **Professional Review**: Have medical content reviewed when possible

## 🛠️ Security Tools and Processes

### Automated Security

```bash
# Run security audit
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

### Manual Security Checks

- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security implications
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Dependency Review**: Manual review of new dependencies
- **Configuration Audit**: Regular review of security configurations

## 📋 Security Checklist for Releases

- [ ] **Dependency Audit**: All dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Code Review**: Security-focused code review completed
- [ ] **Configuration Check**: Security headers and CSP verified
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: No secrets in code or logs
- [ ] **Docker Security**: Container images scanned
- [ ] **Medical Content**: Health information accuracy verified
- [ ] **Privacy Compliance**: Data handling practices reviewed

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting users rather than the application
- **Physical Security**: Physical access to servers or devices
- **Denial of Service**: DoS attacks (unless demonstrating a significant vulnerability)
- **Spam or Content Issues**: Non-security related content problems
- **Third-Party Services**: Vulnerabilities in external services we don't control

## 🏆 Recognition
